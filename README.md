# TITANIC-SURVIVAL-ANALYSIS
This program gives detailed information on the various categories which led to the survival of a person in the Titanic which sank in 1912 in the North Atlantic Ocean. There are various charts, survival percentage which is produced from comparing one or more columns/categories with each other.  I have a another repository for testing and training this data that you can help yourself with to learn.

In this program we use various machine learning analysis techqniques which will be detaily explained on the 'titanicsurvivalexploratory.ipynb' file. 


#Exploration of Data:
This is more of a explanatory file where I went exploring various information in the data that was given to us.  You can feel free to use this code to learn.

#Traing and Testing Code
I have added a another repository on how to train and test the data.  Feel free to check that out.
